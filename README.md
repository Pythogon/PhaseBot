# PhaseBot

PhaseBot is a utility bot written for SoleNyu by Ash on behalf of Pythogon.    
It is designed to have several features, from chat tools such as a built-in starboard to useful commands for checking comments on Instagram posts and even a RNN to generate crazy new scenarios for LIFE: The Game.

## What even is LIFE?
