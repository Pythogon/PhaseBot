## Dependencies

There is a script in the project root that will fetch dependencies for your system and optionally install them.
On Windows use `getdeps.bat` and on macOS & Linux use `getdeps.sh`. Optional flags can be viewed using the `-h` switch

## Running

To run PhaseBot, execute the respective run script for your system.
On Windows use `phase.bat`,  and on Unices use `phase.sh`.

Phase does not currently take any arguments (Perhaps a good idea? Add switches etc.)
