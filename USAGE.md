NOTE: The Windows scripts are currently less featured than their `bash` counterparts, this is being remedied. In the meantime use WSL

## Dependencies & Setup

There is a script in the project root that will fetch dependencies and setup the bot environment for your system.

On Windows use `getdeps.bat` and on macOS & Linux use `getdeps.sh`. Optional flags can be viewed using the `-h` switch

## Running

To run PhaseBot, execute the respective run script for your system.
On Windows use `phase.bat`, and on macOS & Linux use `phase.sh`. Optional flags can be viewed using the `-h` switch

The `-m` flag will set up the data folder if you are getting IO errors
