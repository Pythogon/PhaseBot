Welcome to LIFE: The Game's official Discord server!
My name is PhaseBot and I was built to make your server experience the best it can be.

**__A brief guide to our server__**
#le-noir is the place to be for discussion! All of the main conversation takes place there (just mind Roxane!).

#announcements contains... well... announcements. Duh. All of the important stuff happpens in #announcements (but it can be a bit wordy, don't tell Sole).

The #art and #meme-corners are for showing only the most refined and relevant masterpieces, such as Thea Monstertruck and Clash of Clans.

#starcastle is my home and where I show the fully-democratic community-approved **best** posts on the server.

#consulting-the-deities is the place to run commands for myself, but also the other bot, SoulBot.

**__Recommended first reads__**

I'd recommend running the following commands in #consulting-the-deities when you get the chance:
`)help`
`)starinfo`
`)rate @yourself`

Welcome again, and have fun!
